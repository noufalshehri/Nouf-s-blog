                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
                </h1>
                <p class="post-text">is one of the three cornerstones of the
                    web,
                    along with
                    <i> HTML and JavaScript.</i> <br> It’s what brings life to websites through
                    <u>colours, styling, positioning and much more.</u> Thus, knowing CSS is hugely valuable in today’s
                    labour market! <br>

                    So I’m happy to announce that we’ve just launched a free CSS course on Scrimba. It’s created by
                    our
                    brilliant instructor Eric Tirado, who also did our popular intro to HTML course. <br>

                    In less than an hour, Eric will take you from zero to proficient in CSS! <br>

                    Let’s have a look at how the course is laid out. <br>
                    <b>Part #1: Introduction</b>
                    <br>
                    In the introductory video, Eric will give you an overview of what the course looks like, what
                    the
                    pre-requisites are, plus an overview of the topics he touches throughout the course. He also
                    gives
                    you a brief introduction about himself so you get familiar with him before jumping off. <br>
                    <b>Part #2: CSS Documents & The Cascade</b> <br>
                    We then jump directly into the first formal lesson of the course. In this one, we will be
                    looking
                    into the ways we can include CSS in our HTML pages and how to start applying basic stylings on
                    our
                    elements. <br>

                        alt="blog-post-image"> <br>
                    <b>Part #3: CSS Selectors, Properties, & Values</b> <br>
                    In the second lesson, Eric talks about some of the CSS vocabulary which sets you up to better
                    understand concepts he goes through in later lectures. You’ll learn what HTML elements are, what
                    CSS
                    selectors are, and how you can apply properties and assign values to them.
                    <br>
                    <b>CSS Vocabulary</b> <br>

                    So, for example, this is an h1 element. It has some default styling which appears when you
                    render it
                    in the browser. If we want to change some styling, we can use CSS: <br>
                    <code>h1 {  
                        color: 'red';  
                     }</code>
                    <br>
                    The selector for our h1 element is simply the name of the element itself, and then we assign it
                    the
                    property of color with the value of red. In the same way, we can select elements using Classes
                    and
                    IDs as well, which is discussed in later videos.
                    <br>
                    <b>Part #4: Classes and IDs</b>
                    <br>
                    This part of the course discusses how to use classes and IDs in CSS to select HTML elements and
                    apply different styling on them. It also discusses in detail the difference between Class and
                    ID,
                    and how and when we assign them on HTML elements
                    According to w3schools website,
                    <q cite="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp">
                        CSS will provide you <br>
                        Equality for all browsers: Chrome. Firefox Edge. IE. Safari. Opera.
                        <br>
                        Equality for all devices: Desktop. Laptop. Tablet. Mobile.
